# TravelSpotter
 A web application designed to help travelers discover exciting destinations around the world. 
 Users can create accounts, log in, and then manage sightseeing spot details, including names, descriptions, locations, images and price. Additionally, they can add, update, and delete these 
 information. Furthermore, users can also contribute, edit and delete reviews for these spots.
 The app also features a cluster map, enabling users to easily visualize the number of tourist attractions within a particular region. Users can zoom in or out on the map to explore the area and access relevant details.
